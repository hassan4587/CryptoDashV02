      <p>
        CryptoDash is a simple React-based cryptocurrency dashboard built to
        practice real-world development skills. It displays live data for
        popular coins, including their prices, market caps, and daily changes,
        all in a clean and easy-to-read interface. Users can quickly filter,
        sort, and browse coins to get a fast overview of the market. This
        project focuses on building responsive UI, working with APIs, and
        managing state in React while creating something practical and visually
        polished.
